--- Write your MySQL query statement below
select (
    select distinct salary
    from Employee
    order by salary desc
    limit 1 offset 1
) as SecondHighestSalary;

-- Alternative approach:
-- select max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary
-- from Employee
-- where salary < (select max(salary) from Employee);

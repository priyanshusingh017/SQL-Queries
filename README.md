## Sample Queries

### Basic Example
```sql
-- Find employees with salary > 50000
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000
ORDER BY salary DESC;
```
### Intermediate Example
```sql
-- Average salary by department
SELECT d.department_name, 
       COUNT(e.employee_id) AS employee_count,
       AVG(e.salary) AS avg_salary
FROM departments d
JOIN employees e ON d.department_id = e.department_id
GROUP BY d.department_name
HAVING AVG(e.salary) > 45000;
```
### Advanced Example
```sql
-- Running total with window functions
SELECT 
    sales_date,
    sales_amount,
    SUM(sales_amount) OVER (ORDER BY sales_date) AS running_total
FROM sales
ORDER BY sales_date;
```

## Quick Reference

### SQL Command Categories
```sql
-- Data Query Language (DQL)
SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY

-- Data Manipulation Language (DML)
INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE

-- Data Definition Language (DDL)
CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME

-- Data Control Language (DCL)
GRANT, REVOKE

-- Transaction Control Language (TCL)

```

### Common Patterns

```sql
-- Basic Query Structure
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column1
HAVING group_condition
ORDER BY column1;

-- JOIN Pattern
SELECT t1.column, t2.column
FROM table1 t1
[JOIN TYPE] JOIN table2 t2 
    ON t1.id = t2.foreign_id
[WHERE additional_conditions];

```
